            <h2>How to tweek this project for your own use</h2>

            <p>You are free to use and make changes is my code. I would recommend you to clone and rename this project and use it for your own purpose. Certain points need to be kept in mind while you make any changes.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Even though CSS file has been structured using comments, HTML file is structured but lacks comments and JS file is just coarse.</li>
                <li>Folder structuring is not done properly as this was my earliest of projects and I was ignorant.</li>
                <li>Image resources cannot be accessed as they are stored as ftp. You will find image url and not any path.</li>
            </ol>
